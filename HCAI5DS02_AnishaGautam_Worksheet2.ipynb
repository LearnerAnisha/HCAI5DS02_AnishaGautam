    "For the product categorized by HighReturn = 1, ReviewRating = 1.5, HasComplaint = True, and VerifiedPurhase = False, the composite risk score is 3, indicating a high likelihood of defectiveness. Accordingly, a targeted recall or in-depth quality inspection is warranted to mitigate customer dissatisfaction and protect brand reputation. This decision underscores the importance of multi-factor analysis rather than reliance on return rates alone."
